Here I Have uploaded all the three tasks of my Web Development Internship Level-I by CODSOFT.
for the Portfolio Task, I have uploaded them(Both HTML and CSS files) separately as there is some issue when i upload them as a folder as the name of the folder matches with my some old repository or something.
So for only the Portfolio task i have uploaded it separately in this repository named as index.html and style.css.

Site Link for Portfolio:  https://aswininfo.netlify.app
